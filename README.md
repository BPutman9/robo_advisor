## Day 1 ##

## Project Summary ##

Our team is building a robo advisor to help individual investors assess potential investment performance based on their:

- Investment horizon
- Initial investment amount and future contributions
- Asset selection
- Appetite for risk

## Project Goal ##

Leverage the user inputs to feed our Python code to make the process as automated as possible. The user's inputs will impact the investment results which will be displayed on an investor dashboard. 

## Questions to be Answered ##

- How does a user's investment time period impact their returns? 
- How does a user's aggressive, moderate, or conservative investment approach affect long-term gains?
- Do annual contributions have a material impact the compounding of the portfolio's return?
- Does rebalancing the portfolio meaningfully improve the performance of the retirement portfolio?

## Day 2 ##


### Our Data Set ###

Our data was generated using the Alpaca API. We chose a 10 year historical window as 10 year historical performance is an industry standard in assessing an asset's performance
We also felt this date range covered both up and down markets so as to not risk being skewed by using a shorter timeframe

### The Questions We Will Address ###

- How can we create both a low cost option, while still providing the client with guidance along the way?
- Can we leverage user input to offer a variety of investment options?
- Can we help motivate an investor by showing them the cost of doing nothing?

### The Packages to be Used ###

- Pandas
- Panel
- OS 
- Dotenv
- Hvplots
- Plotly Express
- Alpaca Trade API
- Matplotlib

### Analysis Methods to be Used ###
- Returns and cumulative returns
- Standard deviation
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Data plotting and visualization   

## Day 3 ##

- Further code development
- PowerPoint draft presentation created

## Day 4 ##

- Edge testing performed
- Additional visualizations created
- Iteration to allow for both a starting investment amount as well as recurring investment amount added
- Python library not used in class added
